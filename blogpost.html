    <h2> Saiho Ji Gargen </h2>
    <p> The famous moss garden of Saihō-ji is situated in the eastern temple grounds. Located in a grove, the garden is arranged as a circular promenade centered on Golden Pond (黄金池 ōgonchi?). The pond is shaped like the Chinese character for "heart" or "mind" (心 kokoro?) and contains three small islands: Asahi Island (朝日島?), Yūhi Island (夕日島?), and Kiri Island (霧島?). The area around the pond is said to be covered with more than 120 varieties of moss, believed to have started growing after the flooding of the temple grounds in the Edo Period. The garden itself contains three tea houses: Shōnan-tei (湘南亭?), Shōan-dō (少庵堂?), and Tanhoku-tei (潭北亭?). </p>
